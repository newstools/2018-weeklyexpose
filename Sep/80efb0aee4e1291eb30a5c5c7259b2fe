JOHANNESBURG, September 21 – Cash-in-transit heist accused has been sentenced to 25 years imprisonment by the Pietermaritzburg High Court, the directorate for priority crime investigation better known as Hawks said on Friday. Spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said in October 2014, Nicholas Mkhanyiseni Mdluli, 50, and his accomplices attacked security guards who were transporting cash at Gingindlovu area. They fired shots at the vehicle until it halted, they then poured petrol over the vehicle threatening to burn it and ordered security guards to come out. They robbed them off their firearms and made off with an undisclosed amount of cash. “Police swiftly responded and a shoot-out ensued. Members managed to arrest one suspect and the case docket was transferred to Hawks members in Richards Bay Organised Crime unit for intensive investigation,” said Mhlongo. “Hawks members followed-up information and a second accused, Salakuliwa Welcome Msimango, 48, was later arrested. Msimango was found in possession of three unlicensed firearms and ammunition.” Mhlongo said Msimango was found guilty for possession of unlicensed firearms and was sentenced to eight years imprisonment.
