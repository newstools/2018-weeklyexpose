TSHWANE, September 6 – Officials from the Gauteng department of education were on Thursday denied entry at a private school they intend to shut down for operating illegally. A government delegation led by Hilda Kekana, Tshwane South district director negotiated unsuccessfully with those who run the Centauri Dual Medium Private High School in Centurion. “This is a private property. No one is entering. I have spoken to national intelligence. You take a picture …” a woman inside the premises shouted at education officials and journalists, before rushing back into the house. The education officials then went to the Wierdabrug police station, to open a case of illegally operating a school. Gauteng Education spokesperson Steve Mabona said the operational registration of the school was withdrawn by the provincial department in April 2018, for non adherence to the post registration requirements. “However, the school ignored the correspondence and continued to operate,” he said. “Among others, the school contravened the curriculum policy, multi-grade teaching is a norm, disregard of assessment and examination processes, utilization of unqualified teachers without SACE (South African Council for Educators) certificates, timetable not CAPS complaint, and learner tasks not CAPS complaint.”   (ANA)
