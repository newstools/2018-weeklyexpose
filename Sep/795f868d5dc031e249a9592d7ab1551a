WELLINGTON, New Zealand, September 15 – Springbok captain Siya Kolisi praised the team’s belief which he said was at the heart of their 36-34 Rugby Championship win over New Zealand at the Westpac Stadium in Wellington on Saturday. Fresh off the back of last weekend’s 23-18 reverse at the hands of the Australians at the Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, the SA captain battled for words to describe how his team had managed to beat New Zealand in their own backyard. “We struggled in the scrums last week and this week we didn’t do anything different, it is just the belief among the players,” said the SA skipper. “It has been a tough couple of weeks for the boys. Our main thing is the effort in the team. We let ourselves down in the last couple of games. It is just about belief. The boys backed each other today.” Kolisi gave credit to the Springbok coaching staff. “They (the coaching staff) kept calm and didn’t put pressure on us,” said Kolisi. “It hasn’t been a different week. They (the coaching staff) just kept believing in us and backed us all the time.” The Springboks will face Australia in the return leg at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth on September 29, before taking on the All Blacks at Loftus Stadium in Pretoria on October 6. (ANA)
