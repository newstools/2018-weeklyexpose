LONDON, England, September 18 – England Rugby on Tuesday confirmed John Mitchell has been appointed as England’s new defence coach until the end of Rugby World Cup 2019. Mitchell will leave his executive of rugby role at the SA Super Rugby side, the Bulls, to join the England set up in September ahead of November’s Internationals. The 54-year-old is a vastly-experienced coach and former player. The New Zealander was an England assistant coach between 1997 and 2000 under Sir Clive Woodward for 33 Tests and has coached domestically in the Premiership at both Wasps – reaching the European Cup quarterfinal – and Sale Sharks. “This is an exciting opportunity to work with England Rugby and support Eddie Jones as head coach,” said Mitchell. “I will be joining an elite high-performance programme, Test team and coaching group where I will use all my experience and focus to bring the necessary clarity and confidence to the players from a defensive perspective.” In 2001, he was appointed head coach of the All Blacks, winning 23 of 28 Tests, including one draw, and led New Zealand to a third-place finish in the 2003 Rugby World Cup. The All Blacks also won back-to-back Tri Nations titles under his leadership. Jones added: “Defence is a key pillar of our game and John is an experienced coach. “He’s coached the All Blacks, USA Rugby and a number of Super Rugby sides so he will bring a wealth of experience and add to the coaching mix we have here.” (ANA)
