JOHANNESBURG, September 20 – Wage negotiations between the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) and Sibanye-Stillwater reached a deadlock once again on Thursday. “No agreement has been reached and wage talks continue,” Amcu said in a terse statement. This as Amcu, along with other gold-sector unions, continued gold wage conciliation processes with Sibanye, Harmony Gold, and Village Main Reef under the auspices of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). On Monday, Amcu, UASA and Solidarity signed a three-year wage agreement with AngloGold Ashanti signed an agreement which gave workers an increment of R1,000 a year over three years. Amcu also achieved a 6.5 percent increase for miners, artisans and officials – 0.5 percent more than the mandated six percent. The National Union of Mineworkers is no longer part of conciliation processes as it declared a dispute with the gold producers. (ANA)
