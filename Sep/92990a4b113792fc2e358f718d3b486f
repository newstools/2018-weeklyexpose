MONROVIA, Liberia, September 14 – The Record of Sport Soccer Statistics Foundation (RSSSF) has confirmed former World Footballer of the Year George Weah as the oldest international player on record. The 51-year-old Weah, current Liberia President, played for Liberia in an international friendly against Nigeria in Monrovia on Tuesday. Nigeria won the match 2-1. Weah played for 79 minutes before he was substituted in the match held to retire the number 14 shirt won by Weah. During the peak of his career he won the Fifa World player of the Year in 1995. The RSSSF  is an international organisation dedicated to collecting statistics about association football. The organisation has drawn a few hundred statisticians from around the world who collect data on men’s and women’s football wherever it is played. “Weah became the oldest player, male or female, to play in the national team of a Fifa member,” said Neil Morrison from the RSSSF group. “There are various caveats associated with this statement,” added Morrison. “(Namely) that (Weah’s) date of birth is correct and the fact that we don’t have complete information of all players and all their dates of birth over the years.” (ANA)
