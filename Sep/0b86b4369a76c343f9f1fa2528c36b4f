JOHANNESBURG, September 20 – After opting to play in Durban in recent months, Bafana Bafana will make a return to the FNB Stadium to host Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Seychelles and Nigeria. South Africa last played at the venue almost a year ago (October 2017) when they thrashed Burkina Faso 3-1 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, with goals from Percy Tau, Themba Zwane and Sibusiso Vilakazi. Stuart Baxter’s men will play Seychelles in back to back home and away matches – the first one scheduled for Saturday, 13 October, with a 15h00 kickoff. The second will take place on Tuesday, 16 October at Stade Linite in Seychelles at 16h30 local time (18h30 South African time) – Seychelles is two hours ahead of South Africa. Bafana Bafana will then host the clash against the Super Eagles at the 2010 World Cup Final venue on Saturday, 17 November in their penultimate 2019 AFCON qualifier {kick-off 15h00). Bafana Bafana are in second position in Group E after two matches, following the victory over Nigeria and a goalless draw against Libya earlier this month (Saturday, 8 September) in Durban, while the Super Eagles are in third place with three points after getting their campaign back on track with a 3-0 win over Seychelles. Libya, who defeated the Islanders 5-1 in the first round of qualifiers, have the same number of points with South Africa but top the group due to a better goal difference. Seychelles are yet to collect points and are bottom of the table. Bafana Bafana’s last match in the qualifiers will be away to Libya on the weekend of 22/23 March next year. (ANA)
