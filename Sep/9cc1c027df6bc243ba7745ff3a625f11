Two years after being handed a four-year ban from football, Soccer Laduma has reported that Thandani ‘Bibo’ Ntshumayelo has managed to successfully appeal his sentence. After testing positive for cocaine back in 2016, the then Orlando Pirates midfielder was handed a lengthy four-year ban that effectively ended his football career. Now though, after a successful appeal, the paper reported that they were been informed that he can immediately return to playing football if he can find himself a club. ‘Bibo’, who turned 28 earlier this year, has been given a lifeline to get his career back on track, and he will now be hoping for a team to take a chance on him as he looks to get back into the Premier Soccer League following his ban from the South African Institute for Drug Free Sport (SAIDS). Ntshumayelo revealed recently that he was working hard to try and get his sentence reduced, and it has now been confirmed by his attorney, Mpho Sethaba, from Fluxmans Attorneys. Speaking to Soccer Laduma, Sethaba said, “Thandani was found guilty of an anti-doping violation in August 2016 and a four-year sanction was imposed. Thandani was recently given an opportunity to appeal the sanction and did so in July 2018. The appeal was filed on the basis that the appropriate sanction should have been two years”. “The appeal panel has found in favour of Thandani and reduced his sanction to two years. The effect of the ruling by the appeal panel is that Thandani can immediately return to football as he has served a period in excess of two years.” Solly Makganoto/Soccer Laduma
