JOHANNESBURG, September 3  – A 13-year-old girl was killed and 18 others injured on Monday morning after a taxi rollover on the Frikkie Meyer Road in Vanderbijlpark, Gauteng, the ER24 paramedic service said. Spokesman Russel Meiring said when ER24 paramedics, along with several other services, arrived on the scene they found a girl sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. “Unfortunately, nothing could be done for her and she was declared dead,” said Meiring. Several other people were found lying around the scene after they had been ejected from the vehicle. “Approximately 18 other patients were assessed on the scene. Two patients, a 16-year-old boy as well as another adult man, had both sustained numerous injuries and were in a critical condition and 16 others had sustained minor to moderate injuries,” said Meiring.
