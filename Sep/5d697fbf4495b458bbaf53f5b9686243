CAPE TOWN, September 19 – Alan Winde was on Wednesday named as the Democratic Alliance (DA) premier candidate for the Western Cape. Making the announcement, DA leader Mmusi Maimane said Winde was the best among six candidates who applied for the prospective post after a rigorous selection process. The other candidates included DA Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela and MP David Maynier. Speaking at the media briefing, Winde said he would now turn his attention to the election campaign. “This privilege, this honour given to me today starts off with a campaign because of course you can only deliver to win an election,” said Winde. Winde said his first task as premier candidate would be to put to together a team to ‘criss-cross’ the province ahead of the 2019 provincial elections. “We will take the excellent work that the DA has put together in the last 10 years and build on that. There’s a lot of work still to be done out there in the Western Cape and I will definitely make sure we put that team together so we fight this election…” (ANA)
