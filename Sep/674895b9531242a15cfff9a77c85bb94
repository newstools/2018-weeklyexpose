Nearly 4,000 people have been infected with cholera, which has been declared a health emergency in Harare. Zimbabwe’s new Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube has set up an emergency crowd fund to raise money to fight the outbreak.

New Health Minister Obadiah Moyo blamed the opposition-controlled city government. (Reuters)
