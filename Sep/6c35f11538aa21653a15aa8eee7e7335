CAPE TOWN, September 18 – The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Tuesday said the party’s federal executive has chosen Dan Plato to replace Patricia de Lille as mayor of Cape Town. Plato, 57, is currently the Western Cape member of the executive council (MEC) for safety and security and previously served as mayor. He held the post for two years from May 2009 when former DA leader Helen Zille stepped down as mayor to become the party’s leader in the province. De Lille will quit as mayor at the end of October, in a deal with the DA leadership designed to end a year of political warfare between her and the party. Plato was chosen by the party’s selection panel from a field of candidates that included Brett Herron, Ian Neilson and Sharna Fernandez. “The panel recommended that Dan Plato be the DA’s Mayor of Cape Town, and FedEx has this morning ratified that decision. FedEx warmly congratulate Mr Plato on his nomination, pledge to him our full support, and wish him every success in the task ahead.  As the DA, we are confident that Mr Plato will continue the progress we are making in the City of Cape Town,” the federal executive said. Plato is a former anti-apartheid activist who became a full time politician in 1996. He will have the twin tasks of uniting a city council that was riven by tension under De Lille and shoring up the DA’s support in Cape Town ahead of national elections next year. The party’s federal executive also announced that DA leader Mmusi Maimane has turned down a request for him to stand as the party’s premier candidate for the Western Cape. (ANA)
