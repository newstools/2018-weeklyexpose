JOHANNESBURG, September 18 – The National Soccer League on Tuesday noted the ‘alleged comments’ of David Thidiela, the chairman of Black Leopards Football Club, at Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday. Thidiela was believed to have been angry with the referee Victor Hlungwani after Black Leopards lost to Bloemfontein Celtic 1-0 in their Premiership encounter. Thidiela was quoted as saying afterwards: “Where I am playing please don’t come, I don’t have a problem with anyone, but we can do without you Hlungwani,” said Thidiela. “Don’t come here, you can come here at own risk, I am giving the last warning, I am tired of you.” In response, the NSL issued the following statement: “The League distances itself from any comment or utterance such as that which has been reported. Black Leopards is a member of the League, and both the club and Mr. Thidiela are bound by the NSL Handbook.  If the reported utterances are true, this would contravene the League Code of Ethics. Mr. Thidiela has been afforded an opportunity to respond to this matter and provide such information as may be relevant. The matter will serve before the Executive Committee and the highest decision making body of the League, the Board of Governors, at a meeting that has been called for this Thursday, September 20.”  (ANA)
