JOHANNESBURG, September 21 –  Mark Alexander, President of SA Rugby, on Friday extended condolences to the family of Kyle Barnes, a first team player for Goodwood Rugby Club in Cape Town, who passed away on Thursday. Barnes, 31, was on life support at a Somerset-West hospital following a head injury sustained in a match against Strand last weekend. His family decided to switch off the life support after he was declared brain dead. “It is a tragic day when a player loses his life due to a rugby injury and we want to extend our condolences to the family and friends of Kyle Barnes,” said Alexander. “We would also like to extend condolences to the Goodwood Rugby Club, his teammates and their opponents on the day, Strand Rugby Club, as this incident affected all involved. May his soul rest in peace.” (ANA)
