PRETORIA, September 20 â€“ South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) governor Lesetja Kganyago announced on Thursday that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.5 percent per annum, as external risks to the rand are expected to make the rand remain volatile due to tighter global financial conditions and the change in investor sentiment towards emerging markets. Kganyago said that four members of the MPC preferred an unchanged stance and three members preferred a 25 basis points increase. He reiterated that quarter-on-quarter GDP contracted by 0.7 percent in the second quarter, revised down from -2.2 percent to -2.6 percent, though year-on-year basis, GDP growth in the first quarter was 0.8 percent The Reserve Bank now forecasts growth in 2018 to average 0.7 percent, down from 1.2 percent in July. Kganyago said that headline inflation was now expected to remain at an average 4.8 percent in 2018, before increasing to 5.7 percent in 2019, up from a 5.6 percent projection, and moderating to 5.4 percent in 2020.
