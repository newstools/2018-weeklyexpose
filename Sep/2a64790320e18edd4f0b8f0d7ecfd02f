JOHANNESBURG, September 4 – Metrorail has said that a total 112 commuters, mostly without valid train tickets, sustained minor injuries and seven with serious but not critical injuries are receiving medical attention at four local hospitals after a collision between two passenger trains in Johannesburg. This comes after a Metrorail train 9708 travelling from Faraday towards New Canada collided head on with a Naledi Jikeleza Train 9949 on Tuesday morning at around 07h10. Goodman Matampi, acting provincial manager for Gauteng Metrorail, said four of the train crew members were also receiving medical assessments and will receive psychological support. “The accident is regrettable and happened while the trains were authorized manually in the section due to a signalling upgrade program that is underway. Metrorail management offers its messages of speedy recovery to the injured commuters,” Matampi said. Matampi said the cause of the accident was currently being investigated by a Metrorail team on the ground and detailed information will be released in due course. A board of inquiry will be instituted to determine the root cause of the accident and Passenger Rail of South Africa (Prasa) will be working closely with the Railway Safety Regulator. Matampi said that the safety of all commuters and employees is taken very seriously and remains their number one priority. (ANA)
