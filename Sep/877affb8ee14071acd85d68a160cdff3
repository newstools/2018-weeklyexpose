Solly Makganoto The tension between Cassper Nyovets and Tsonga musician Benny Mayengani over the #FillUp concept seems to be gaining momentum. Mayengani used the concept #FillUp for his #FillUpGiyaniStadium last weekend much to the disapproval of Nyovest, who took to social media to argue that he came up with the concept and therefore, no one has the right to use the concept as he claims to have trademarked it. Nyovets has since approached his legal team to deal with Mayengani. One would just have to wait and wonder what the outcome would be on this battle, which seems to be far from over. Whilst Nyovet is busy preparing for the legal battle, Mayengani on the other hand is preparing to #FillUpPeterMokabaStadium in December, the very same month that Casspper would be hosting the #FillUpMosesMabhida.  Cassper’s manager TLee slammed Julius Malema on Twitter after the EFF leader labelled Cassper a “bully”.  You take a stance for your homeboy when you know well & clear what he’s doing is 100% wrong is not only opportunistic but embarrassing. I have so much respect for you, this is actually disgusting, we are NOT politicians! You are sacrificing the hard work of another Black Kid!! https://t.co/GHf0cm27sA — December 1st..

You know the law.. you are one of the smartest people I’ve spoken to, so we ALL know this is all to seem like you standing up against bullies for your politics. This is Cassper & his family’s BREAD! DO NOT BULLY A BLACK CHILD FOR POLITICAL GAIN!! You guy is stealing & you know it https://t.co/GHf0cm27sA — December 1st.. Si On (@BridgeBossTLee) September 6, 2018  Social media has since been divided on the issue after it broke out.  This Cassper of yours is behaving like Afriforum. He expropriated #FillUp from Orlando Pirates without compensation and now wants to be compensated for it. Remember Whites who stole our land want us to compensate them for it because they got some title deeds for it. pic.twitter.com/Rv5f4mLOc4 — #SinuousLinesDesign (@Sentletse) September 7, 2018   #FillUp is a pay-off-line composed & created by Cassper for his commercial intention. Fact that some among us were able to uplift the ANCYL concept of “economic freedom” & repurpose it, it doesn’t mean the same is allowed in commercial space. — Bo Mbindwane (@mbindwane) September 6, 2018   This Is not a fight against Cassper and Tsonga people, this is a fight of ownership, trademark, it’s simple law. Tsonga people stop being stubborn it’s not your fight. We all started saying #FillUp because of Cassper!!#FillUpMosesMabhida#FillUp — Julius Mnisi  (@MnisiJulius) September 6, 2018   Am scared to #FillUp, i don’t have a laywer #FillUpChallengeWithDaniel pic.twitter.com/dBOR2jWdkb — Frekkie Sekabate (@fanafr) September 6, 2018   I expected @Julius_S_Malema to bring peace between Benny & Cassper but boy his eyes were already in 2019. He trashes the other because I believe he seeks votes from Giyani at his home province. In fact he should have mind his own business if he cannot bring leadership. #FillUp — Not Adv Ngcukaitobi (@AdvNgcukaitobi) September 6, 2018  3 years later you are taking the same dreamers to court #FillUp pic.twitter.com/kuQeRcjqEo — The Instigator (@Am_Blujay) September 6, 2018
