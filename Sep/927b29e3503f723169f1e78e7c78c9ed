HILLCREST, September 21  – The Mountain Bike Challenge from Hillcrest to Hilltop Camp, Hluhluwe in the height of KwaZulu-Natal’s summer and with a 16 hour cut-off time will be one of the sternest tests on the cycling calendar on December 8. This year there is an expanded expedition including a three-day option, while the famous one-day Long Horn and Short Horn options and the 100km Baby Horn and 35km Orphan rides will be ridden on the Saturday. The 340km Long Horn remains the ultimate endurance test while the ‘easier’ 240km Short Horn event offers a more fun ride that takes place at a more manageable pace but still remains a tough challenge.
