JOHANNESBURG, September 18 – President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday, congratulated the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) on its election of new national officials led by the federation’s first woman President, Zingiswa Losi. “Cosatu plays a critical role in the lives of South Africa’s workers and is a vital ally in our national effort to achieve inclusive growth in our economy and equality and cohesion in our society,” he said. Ramaphosa said the unopposed election of Cosatu’s new leaders was an indicator of the unity of vision and purpose with which workers and leaders are engaging in moving South Africa forward. He extended his congratulation to Losi who has been elected as the first female President of the federation. Bheki Ntshalintshali is going to stay as general secretary, and Solly Phetoe as his deputy. Losi previously served as second deputy resident of Cosatu and is a member of the African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee. “Ms Losi’s election as president of Cosatu affirms women — and black women in particular — as political activists and social reformers, leaders in their own right and agents of their own liberation,” Ramaphosa said. Outgoing Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini has announced that the elections agency will announce the name of the new office bearers on Thursday.  (ANA)
