CAPE TOWN, September 25 –  Eight people have been arrested for public violence following run-ins with police that resulted in the disruption of traffic in various areas of the metropole. Residents took part in a shutdown of the city, claiming that nothing has changed for them since the fall of apartheid. Areas such as Bonteheuwel, Ottery, Hanover Park and Kensington were affected by the shutdown which saw numerous roads closed off by protesters and police and city law enforcement agencies deployed. “Stun grenades and rubber bullets were fired in an effort to restore calm. Police continue to monitor the situation, urging protesters to carry themselves in an orderly manner that does not infringe on the rights of others.” By late morning all roads had been reopened to traffic.
