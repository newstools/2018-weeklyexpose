CAPE TOWN, September 25 – Organisers of the Cape Town International Jazz Festival on Tuesday announced further artists set to perform at the annual jazz extravaganza which is set to take place in March next year. South African jazz legend Don Laka, chart-topping vocalist Craig Lucas, seven-piece indigenous band BCUC, local jazz master and saxophonist Don Vino, and the Soweto Gospel Choir are among the stellar names announced by organisers espAfrika. In a statement, espAfrika said over the next few months it would announce various other artists set to perform at the 20th celebration of Africa’s Grandest Gathering which is held annually in Cape Town. The festival will take place on March 29-30, 2019, at the Cape Town International Convention Centre. Acknowledging September as heritage month, the organisers said the announcement of the latest artist line-up celebrated South Africa’s diversity, following on from its initial artist reveal in August when several female singers were named in honour of Women’s Month. Festival director Billy Domingo said the festival continuously strives for a line-up balancing South African, African and international artists. “International guests come to South Africa to see artists they are not able to see back at home. We have created a legacy of supporting South African artists by providing the international platform they deserve,” said Domingo. “South African artists add to the rich musical heritage and then, combined with the international acts, provide the unique programming that is synonymous with Africa’s Grandest Gathering.” Official sponsors of the 20th annual Cape Town International Jazz Festival are the Department of Arts and Culture, Independent Media, AYO Technology Solutions and host city, the City of Cape Town.
