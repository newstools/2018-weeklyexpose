JOHANNESBURG, August 28 – US President Donald Trump reportedly told his aides he never wanted to meet someone as “lifeless” as Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari again, Ghana Web reported on Wednesday. Buhari met with Trump earlier in the year, the first African president to meet the US president in the White House. On Monday Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta was the second African leader to be hosted by Trump to discuss security and other bilateral issues. Trump’s remarks came after Buhari’s visit to the White House earlier this year, said a BBC report quoting Financial Times. “Trump likes chemistry. Africa has never been high on his radar but if the big guy likes you he’ll find a way to make things work,” an unnamed source reportedly told the Financial Times ahead of a meeting between Trump and Kenyatta on Monday. During their meeting Trump reportedly asked Buhari what the situation was with “that Boca Haram” referring to Boko Haram and also showed little understanding of the conflict between herdsmen and farmers in Nigeria, owing it only to a religious divide and a Christian genocide. Trump’s condescension towards Africa has included calling it a “shithole”, his mispronunciation of Namibia as “Nambia” and his latest tweet weighing in on the matters of land ownership in South Africa. On Monday Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta was the second African leader to be hosted by Trump to discuss security and other bilateral issues. The meeting came as Kenya emerges from a period of election turmoil. (ANA)
