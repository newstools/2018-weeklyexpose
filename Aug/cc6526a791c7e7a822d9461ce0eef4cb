JOHANNESBURG, August 27 – Zimbabwe’s main opposition leader Nelson Chamisa says he has a legitimate claim to lead the southern African nation after rejecting a court ruling that confirmed President Emmerson Mnangagwa as winner of the July 30 presidential election, Reuters reported. Chamisa maintained that he had won the first election since the departure of Robert Mugabe last November and said the Constitutional Court had foiled his bid to subpoena the election commission to provide critical proof to bolster his case. In another news,  Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa says he will soon appoint a commission of inquiry to look into the “isolated and unfortunate” post-election violence in which six people were killed when the military dispersed opposition protesters in the capital, AP reported. The findings will be made public.
